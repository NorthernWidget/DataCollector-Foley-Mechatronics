The files in this directory contain the complete source of a
presentation on Hydrogen Fuel Cells.

To compile, type:

   make

This will execute the commands in the provided Makefile and generate
the file hfc.pdf.

Alternatively, without using the Makefile, you may do:

   pdflatex hfc.tex
   pdflatex hfc.tex

to generate hfc.pdf.  You need to run the pdflatex twice to allow
LaTeX to resolve page numbers, otherwise the page numbers in the
footlines will be wrong.
