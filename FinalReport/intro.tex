\section*{Introduction}
This open source project is a development of wireless data collecting equipment. The project was cooperated with the geologist Dr. Andrew D. Wickert,seen in figure \ref{fig:andrewWickert}, who needed an affordable and light-weight field instrumentation for his research. Dr. Wickert had developed an Arduino-based low-power field environmental data logger as show in figure \ref{fig:BottleLog}. He needed a communication module to fit his data logger and got assistance from Reykjav√≠k University with the development.\\
The goal of the project is to design Arduino based communication module which sends data through GSM network to HTTP server. When accomplished and the project is merged with Dr. Wickert data logger there will exist an affordable light-weight equipment that is not available commercially today. The project's solution is open source and is therefore modifiable.

This report is written in a technical manner and is intended for those with understanding of the matter.
