\section*{Introduction}
This open source project is a development of wireless data collecting equipment called the GeoLog. The project was cooperated with the geologist Dr. Andrew D. Wickert\cite{andrewWickert}, seen in figure \ref{fig:andrewWickert}, who needed an affordable and light-weight field instrumentation for his research. Dr. Wickert had developed an Arduino-based\cite{arduinoMega}  low-power field environmental data logger as show in figure \ref{fig:BottleLog}. He needed a communication module to fit his data logger and sought assistance from Reykjav√≠k University with the development.\\
The goal of the project is to design Arduino based communication module which sends data through GSM network to HTTP server. Later on the project might be integrated with Dr. Wickert low power data logger. With that accomplished the project adds an affordable light-weight equipment that seems to be unavailable on the commercial market. The project's solution is open source see~\url{https://github.com/GeoLogTeam} and is therefore modifiable for anyone who chooses to use the GeoLog.\\
This report is written in a technical manner and is intended for those with understanding of the matter.
