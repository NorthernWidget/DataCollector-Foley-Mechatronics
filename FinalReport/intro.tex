\section*{Introduction}
This open source project is development of wireless data collecting equipment. The project is in cooperation with the geologist Dr .Andrew D. Wickert (seen in figure \ref{fig:andrewWickert}), who has need for affordable and light-weighted field instrumentation for his research. That's why he developed Arduino-based low-power field environmental data logger, as seen in figure \ref{fig:BottleLog}. He sought assistance to Reykjavik University for help with development of communication module that fits his data logger.\\
So the main goal with this project is design of Arduino based communication module that sends data through GSM network to HTTP server. With this accomplished and later on merge with Andy's data logger there will be affordable light-weighted equipment that is not available commercially. The solution will also be highly modifiable because it's open source project.

This report is written in a technical manner and is intended for those with understanding of the matter.
