\begin{tabular}{|p{8cm}|p{8cm}|}
		\hline \textbf{Functional requirements (FR):} & \textbf{Design parameter (DP):} \\ 
		\hline 1) Collect measurable data &   Get temperature with TMP36 sensor\\
		\hline 2) Store data local &   Write temperature values to Arduino MEGA EEPROM \\
		\hline 3) Keeps data for x time &  Arduino MEGA \cite{arduinoMega} has 4kB of EEPROM \\
		\hline 4) Runs on own power source & Have battery pack and minimize power consumption \\ 
		\hline 5) IP67 proof &   Fit all hardware into IP67 fiber box\\
		\hline 6) Sent data wireless through GSM network & Send Jason formated data trough GSM shield \\ 
		\hline 7) Store data on server & Setup HTTP API server \\ 
		\hline 8) Modular Design & Well planed software design architecture \\

The most challenging requirements from table \ref{tbl:FRDP} is the software design. It's very critical to make the hole project modular. Solution to that is decrepit in DP7. Additionally there were added 3x wireless-sensor module to expand the coverage of the mother-base. They use Pololu Wixel to communicate to mother hub. Then the mother hub samples data from them and sends through GSM network to a HTTP server.
