\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}
Project requirement is listed in table \ref{tbl:FRDP} along with design parameters.
It is essential to make the product as modular as possible with well planned software architecture. There fore FR8 is then most challenging. \\
Additionally three wireless sensors modules are to be added to expand the coverage of the mother hub.  The sensors should use Pololu Wixel to communicate to the mother hub that samples data from them and sends through GSM network to a HTTP server.

	\label{tbl:FRDP}
\begin{tabular}{|p{8cm}|p{8cm}|}
		\hline \textbf{Functional requirements (FR):} & \textbf{Design parameter (DP):} \\ 
		\hline 1) Collect measurable data &   Get temperature with TMP36 sensor\\
		\hline 2) Store data local &   Write temperature values to Arduino MEGA EEPROM \\
		\hline 3) Keeps data for amount of time &  Arduino MEGA \cite{arduinoMega} has 4kB of EEPROM \\
		\hline 4) Runs on own power source & Have battery pack and minimize power consumption \\ 
		\hline 5) IP67 proof &   Fit all hardware into IP67 fiber box\\
		\hline 6) Sent data wireless through GSM network & Send Jason formated data trough GSM module \\ 
		\hline 7) Store data on server & Setup HTTP API server \\ 
		\hline 8) Modular Design & Well planed software design architecture \\
