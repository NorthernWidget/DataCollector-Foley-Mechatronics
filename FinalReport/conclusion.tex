\section{Conclusion}
Summary of system capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Measure temperature with 3x wireless sensors modules.
	\item Wireless sensor module sends data through wixel when mother hub ask for them.
	\item Mother hub samples wireless data with given sample rate.
	\item Mother hub stores the data.
	\item Mother hub sends per-sampled data through GSM network to HTTP server.
	\item Mother hub and wireless sensors modules runs on battery power.
	\item Wireless sensors modules ran for hole testing period (24h) on 3x AA battery.
	\item Mother hub ran on 5x parallel 9V batteries during test period.
\end{itemize}
