\section{Design}
\textit{\textcolor{red}{Where/who did the concept come from?}}
The concept for the GeoLog originally came from Dr. Andrew Wickert\ref(fig:andrewWickert),
which came to Reykjav√≠k University's Mechatronics class for help developing his 
design of a low power datalogger\cite{ALog-BottleLogger}. 

\textit{\textcolor{red}{What was the process used to develop the current design?}}
The GeoLog datalogger was designed in phases. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Phase 1:} Initial brainstorming and high level design phase.
	\item{Phase 2:} Hardware selection phase, where hardware was selected and ordered.
	\item{Phase 3:} Software design phase, where the classes and interfaces were designed.
	\item{Phase 4:} Hardware hacking phase, trial and error in software writing for the
					Wixels\cite{wixel} and the GSM/GPRS module\cite{}.
\end{itemize}
First the  Second phase was the  Second phase was the  Third was the
