This report is a proposal of a mechatronic project to do as a
final project in the course T-411-MECH Mechatronics for the fall of 2014.
 

\section{Description}
Andrew Wickert is a PHD candidate in earth surface processes in University of Colorado and has an 
idea of using the Arduino platform as a base for low-cost data logger used mainly
for geological research. The Arduino platform offers a wide range of application and connection to 
sensors. The Arduino community also provides large collection of libraries and various vendors have 
variety of shields for all kind of application. 

This project aims first at making a solid means of communication between data-loggers and mother hub
and secondly of good power-management for the logger.

\section{Application}
The main application of the data logger will be telemetry for returning data. Good telemetry communication for a data logger eases the process of maintenance checks and enables more involved researches.\\
Telemetry via GSM network is available throughout most part of Iceland, see figure~\ref{fig:GSM-Coverage}. With GSM shield on the data logger one might be able to monitor data logging in most places in Iceland.\\
Radio coverage can be quite good over long distance. The XBee modules with Arduino support come with radio ranges for up to 60km \cite{Xbee}. If the data logger is equipped with the Xbee module the researcher might set up a ground station with in a 60km radius.\\
Satellite phone (Iridium) might be connected to the data logger to enable good coverage in remote areas. Iridium phone has coverage anywhere in the world were there is a clear view of the sky, by connecting to any of the 66 iridium satellites in orbit around the earth\cite{iridium}.

\section{Usage} 
 This equipment useful in geological measurements, mainly for weather and water-resources. Especially in remote locations. 
 Geologist Andy Wickert has special interests in this equipment to collect geological data with higher density and wider distribution.
